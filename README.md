# HGR_project
Ethan's repository for EE113DA/DW capstone project in 'Home Gesture Recognition,' a project dedicated to melding gesture recognition with home device control.

This project is trying to use OpenCV and MediaPipe packages to build a gesture recognition project. It seeks to recognize user gestures and then parse those gestures to control home devices over network.
